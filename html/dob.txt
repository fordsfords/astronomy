The following post was made to the sci.astro.amateur newsgroup in response
to one of the religous wars that perpetually flairs - Dob v.s. EQ mounts.
One of the primary arguments used by pro-Dob fans is that they are easier
to learn and use by beginners.  Unfortunately, this advice is usually
given by non-beginners!

One thing I will add to the mix.  Another pro-Dob argument is that they
are quicker to set up.  This is true if you are travelling away from home
to do your observing.  I do most of my observing from my back yard, and
there can be no quicker setup.  I lift the scope, walk out the door, and
set it down.  Done.  No complicated polar alignment (I just set it down with
the polar axis pointing roughly North).  No monkeying with setting circles.

If I'm going to drive to a viewing spot, then I do have to remove three
bolts at home (4 minutes), and put them back in on-location (4 more minutes).
However, these 8 minutes are nothing compared with the bother of driving.

NOTE: for young children, a Dob might be easier to carry than an EQ.  If
choosing a Dob makes the difference for the child being able to set
up without help, then all other arguments pale.  Go with the setup that
the kid can handle himself!!!

Anyway, here's the best post I've seen on the subject:

Subject: Re: Dob vs EQ.. ENOUGH with the dobs!... newbie speaks out!

I'm an "authority" in this newsgroup finally!

I'm a newbie... I bought a used scope with BOTH types of mounts.

Since this thread deals (in part) with the effects of mounts on the
early experiences of newcomers to the hobbie, I guess I'm actually an
"expert" for once.  Read on for my tale and experience...

I recently bought a Criterion RV-6 with EQ mount and clock drive.  I
truly don't know if this counts as a "good" EQ mount but I doubt it's a
bad one.  In the deal came a *very* crude but fair performing homemade
dob mount.  I got the stuff home, and the first thing I went for was the
dob because I had only a little time.  It was surprisingly easy to find
stuff for the first time with the Telrad/dob combo.  I looked forward to
having more time and setting up the EQ.

I'm now comfortable using both and *both* serve a very important role
for me as a newbie.

DOB MOUNT:
1) My kids can reach the eyepiece while standing on the ground, for
crying out loud!!!  This is one of the biggest features for *my* needs. 
We homeschool our kids and the scope is as much for them as myself.  On
the EQ they're dangling in space on a stool which makes it hard for them
and frightening for me.

2) We have 4 kids => little free time.  My wife gets nervous when I
throw open the basement bulkhead doors and THE MOUNT rises out into the
night.  However, I can plop the dob mount outside and when I get a
chance, pop out and view... it's much less of a production.

3) I value it so much, I'm redesigning and building a new one on cloudy
days.  I've been an avid woodworker and an Aerospace engineer for many
years so this now becomes a hobby^2.

4) Very little "inertia" to throwing this in the car to transport it to
friends' house or remote sites.  

EQ MOUNT:
1) I definitely prefer this for high power viewing... one axis vs. 2 to
control or none with the clock drive.  

2) If I really want to study or sketch, it has the benefit (for me) of
keeping the object locked in one degree of freedom.  I can run inside
and change a diaper, or do the dishes, then blast back out and sweep
back to my target.  Or, better yet, just leave the drive running.  Very
helpful!

3) I imagine the setting circles may come in handy, but so far the
Telrad and good charts have made it slick to make a big dent in the
Messier catalogue.

SUMMARY:
As a newbie, BOTH are valuable and serve a vital purpose.  I'm thankful
I have both.  I know I view more often *because* I have the dob mount. 
The EQ is my choice for extended viewing sessions.  If I could only keep
one... it'd have to be the dob (the new one I'm building, that is). 
This is mainly due to convenience, transportability, use with and by my
children, etc.  I'm glad I don't have to pick only one though.  

I'd recommend, if possible, going my route.  Buy a good (assuming mine
is good) EQ mount and for peanuts build a high quality dob mount.  My
children could build one with only a little help.  Then, each night just
pick your poison based on it's circumstances.

Peace,
Keith.
