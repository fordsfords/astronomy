<p>This page is intended for the enjoyment and education of people interested
in the universe.  There are parts of it that are for beginners, other parts
are for people who already know quite a bit about astronomy and want to learn
more.

<p>If you're here about astrology (horoscopes, zodiac, etc) then you're in 
the wrong place.

<p>Sfordsez: if you haven't seen my standard disclaimer and copyright at

then check it out now.

<a name=mine><h3>My Content</h3></a>

<ul>

<li><a href="kid_scope.html">Parent's Guide to Children's Telescopes</a> -
Are you thinking of getting a telescope for your child?  Read this first.
Also, please consider <a href="help_child.html">helping your child</a>
get started with Astronomy.
<br><br>

<li><a href="name_star.html">Buy a Star for a Loved One</a> -
Your Aunt Sally's birthday is coming up.  Can you have a star named after
her?
</ul>

<a name=dyn><h3>Dynamic Content</h3></a>

<p>Pages to bookmark and re-visit because they change every
day/week/month/whatever.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">Astronomy Picture of the Day ("APOD")</a> -
So much <em>more</em> than just pretty pictures, APOD gives explanation,
with plenty of links for more in-depth info.  For example, you can see
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap980109.html">aurora rings on Saturn</a>.
Most of the good web-based information I've found came from APOD links.  And
I <em>love</em> the output from their search function - it outputs the entire
text (with active links) of each matching entry.  For example, do a
<a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/apod/apod_search?tquery=nova">search for
"nova"</a>.
<br><br>

<li><a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/">Sky and Telescope</a>
- The site contains <em>lots</em> of good info, but I'll point out a few
particularly strong pages:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news">News from Sky &amp;
Telescope</a> - contains late-breaking news and info on Astronomy.
<li><a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/ataglance">This Week's
Sky at a Glance</a> - astronomical events and planet roundup.
<li><a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/howto/basics">Stargazing basics</a>
- this page has LOTS of good articles that I've learned a lot from.
</ul>
<br>

<li><a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/vphase.html">Current phase of
the moon</a> - courtesy of the U.S. Naval Observatory.  At the same site:
<a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/sidereal.html">local sidereal time</a>
which can sometimes be useful (e.g. if it's 17:25 LST, it means that RA 17h 25m
is at zenith).
</ul>

<h3>Learning Center</h3>

<p>Mostly tutorials on the science behind astronomy, but some other stuff
too.

<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://www.physics.utah.edu/~cassiday/p1050/Pale_Blue_Dot.html">Reflections
on a mote of dust</a></b> - required reading for all human beings.  Period.
<br><br>

<li><a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/howto/basics">Stargazing basics</a>
- this page has LOTS of good articles that I've learned a lot from.
<br><br>

<li><a href="http://www.windows2universe.org/">Windows to the Universe</a>
- University of Michigan's effort to bring science to the masses.  Very little
fluency in math and science needed.
<br><br>

<li>Pity.  There used to be a nice little tutorial on the history of our
understanding of galaxies at
ftp://crux.astr.ua.edu/web/goodies/data_resources/galaxies.text but it is gone.
<br><br>

<li><a href="https://householdquotes.co.uk/guide-to-backyard-astronomy/">Guide to Backyard Astronomy</a>
is another "list of links", which I normally wouldn't link to, but this
one is a bit more extensive and diverse than mine.
I haven't looked at much of it, but it has been recommended to me.
<br><br>

<li><b><a href="https://diygardening.co.uk/astronomy-guide/">Back Garden
Astronomy</a></b> - a sweet little intro do sky gazing.
Not a lot of meat, but has a heart.
<br><br>

<li><a href="http://sten.astronomycafe.net/who-is-this-guy/">Sten Odenwald's</a> writings are all very interesting and
well-written, and most are easy to understand (some get a little heavy).
I especially like his sections on
<a href="http://sten.astronomycafe.net/cosmology/">cosmology</a>
and <a href="http://sten.astronomycafe.net/category/astronomy/">astronomy</a>.
<br><br>

<li><a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmolog.htm">Ned Wright's
Cosmology Tutorial</a> - This is a bit heavier than Odenwald's tutorials.
Ned actually brings in some of the math.  However, the page referenced
above does contain an interesting "News of the Universe" section.  He
also has a <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/relatvty.htm">Relativity
Tutorial</a>, which is also heavier than Odenwald's.
<br><br>

<li><a href="http://www.ericweisstein.com/encyclopedias/"><b>Eric Weisstein's
encyclopedias</b></a>
- the single largest collection of knowledge and information that I've ever
seen on the web.  This guy should get a Nobel prize for putting it up.
Wolfram hosts his two most-ambitous works:
<a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/">ScienceWorld</a> and
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/">MathWorld</a>.
<br><br>

<li><a href="http://www.modernrelativitysite.com/">Modern Relativity</a>
- David Waite's tutorial on Einstein's theories of relativity.  As a beginner,
I felt that in order to get the most out of it, it required more fluency
in math and general physics than I have.
</ul>

<p>Specific areas that interest me:
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap970925.html">Periodic Novae</a> -
when a binary star system consists of a giant star and a small white dwarf
in fairly close proximity, you can get periodic nova outbursts that result
from a fascinating process.  There is also a
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1997/29/text/">detailed description</a>.
<br><br>

<li><a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/1997/38/text/">Star deaths</a> -
Hubble photos and great explanatory info on how stars die.  This
site has an
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/">index of recent Hubble observations</a>.
<br><br>

<a name=prod><h3>Product Center</h3></a>

<p>I plan on keeping this section short since I'm not into advertising.  But
there are a few products that I feel very good about that I would like
to promote.

<ul>
<li><a href="dob.txt">Keith Wichman on Dob v.s. EQ</a> -
Finally, a true "expert" on the subject of Dobsonian v.s. Equatorial
mounts!  I also have some <a href="eq.html">non-expert comments</a>
on the subject.
<br><br>

<li><a href="skymap.html">SkyMap</a> - a shareware software package for your
MS Windows-based PC.  It can make finding planets and other objects much
easier and less frustrating.  Plus it's just plain fun to play with.

<p>There are also several
<a href="find_planet.html#maps">web-based maps</a> available.
<br><br>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Burnhams-Celestial-Handbook-Observers-Universe/dp/048623567X">Celestial Handbook</a> by Robert Burnham.  It's a 3-volume
set, alphabetically split, so get all three (i.e. scroll to the "frequently
bought together" section).  I can't imagine an amateur
not having it.  Although it is a bit dated, and some of the hard data is
probably off, his mix of hard science, history, opinion, and awe is
unequaled anywhere.
</ul>

<a name="finally">
<h2>And Finally...</h2>

<p>I haven't calculated this out to make sure it's accurate, but I
like it enough that I don't care:

<blockquote><em>If the Earth is the size of a pea in New York, then the
Sun is a beachball 50m away, Pluto is 4km away, and the next nearest
star is in Tokyo.  Now shrink Pluto's orbit into a coffee cup; then our
Milky Way Galaxy fills North America.  </em></blockquote>

Last night
           as I lay in bed
                           looking at the stars
                                                I thought,
     'Where the hell is the ceiling?'
