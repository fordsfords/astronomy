<h1>My Introduction to Astronomy</h1>
<hr>

<p>When I was about 10 years old, I got a telescope from my parents.  I
have no idea how good of a scope it was, although I do remember that it
went up to <a href=kid_scope.html#power>400 power</a>.

<p>I had a lot of fun for a month or two looking at the moon.  I also
found the Orion nebula fascinating.

<p>And that's it.

<p>That is all I found.

<p>Oh sure, I pointed the scope at numerous stars.  And I discovered that
when you look at a little white dot with a telescope, you see a little
white dot.

<p>And I looked and looked for planets.  But I had no idea where to
look or what they would look like if I found them.  I decided that planets
must be soooooo far away that I needed a <em>much</em> better scope
than I had to see even the slightest disk.

<p>I was wrong.

<p>Even a very modest telescope can see a small disk for Venus, Saturn,
and Jupiter.  And that same modest scope can see Saturn's ring.

<p>And I didn't even know about all of the deep-space objects that
are out there, well within the reach of a modest scope.

<p>Also, the Internet didn't exist back then, so my ability to learn
about the stars was limited by what I could find in the local
library.  I never found a book that showed me how to use my telescope
to find interesting objects.

<p>I tried once or twice a month for about a year to use the scope, and
I met with frustration and disappointment.  Finally,
being an engineer at heart, I took the scope apart and played with
the neat lenses.  Eventually, I got it back together and we sold it at
a garage sale for maybe $25 (I don't remember for sure).

<p>Needless to say, neither of my parents, nor anybody else for that
matter, showed the slightest interest in the telescope.  Nobody made
any attempt to help me find anything.  I was left on my own and I failed.

<h3>Now move the clock forward about 30 years . . .</h3>

<p>It's 1997, the year of my 40th birthday.  It's early spring, and my
birthday is still 9 months away.  But comet Hale-Bopp is on it's way,
and it promises to be the best sight in the sky in many years.

<p>Since the comet would be gone by the time my birthday came around,
my wife made me 40 years old a bit early.  In May (or was it June?), she
got me a telescope - an 8-inch Celestron "Celestar-8".

<p>Ironically, a good telescope is a bad way to look at a comet like
Hale-Bopp.  The comet was spread across such a large area of the sky that
even the lowest power magnified the comet too much.  The best views of
the comet were had from simple binoculars.  Even so, I loved the
telescope from the moment I saw it.

<p>Thank goodness for the Internet.  My wife and I were able to learn
all about telescopes and how to use them.  I'm completely hooked on
astronomy now, and I mourn the lost opportunities of 30 years ago.  It
is that sense of loss, and the passion that I now feel, that prompted me
to write my
<a href=index.html>astronomy web pages</a>.

<p>I hope that my
<a href="kid_scope.html">Parent's Guide to Children's Telescopes"</a>
will help prevent this from happening to at least a few promising young
astronomers.
