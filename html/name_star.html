<h1>Naming a Star After Dear Aunt Sally</h1>
<hr>

<p>Here's the scenario: your dear Aunt Sally's birthday is coming up.  She
has everything she wants, including enough ceramic figurines to sink the
Titanic.  When you ask her what she wants, she says, "Oh, just
send a card."

<p>Yeah.  Right.  Your mother will never let you hear the end of it.

<p>Suddenly, you come upon an advertisement in the newspaper.  You can have
a star (of the outer-space variety) named after her.  If you send the company
some dough (Surprise!  It's right within your price range) then that
company will select a star from it's vast catalog, assign it to Sally,
and send her a handsome certificate (suitable for framing, of course)
along with a star chart to help her find "her" star.  They even
lock the catalog in a Swiss bank vault!

<p>It sounds like a "no lose" gift!  Even if Aunt Sally knows that you can't
<em>really</em> get a star named after her, she doesn't know that
<em>you</em> know!  She will be touched by your thoughtfulness and
will proudly hang the certificate in the spare bedroom.

<p>But while you're writing the check, some nagging voice in the
back of your head keeps chanting, "But it's not <em>real</em>."

<p>That voice is right.

<p>The companies that sell stars (there are several) do not have any
"official" status.  You could just as easily set up shop yourself claiming that
you will name grains of sand on Miami Beach.  You create a list of the
numbers from one to a billion, and each time some sucker sends you the
money, you write the name in front of the next available number and
print up a certificate.

<p>Please understand these facts:

<ul>
<li>Nobody but you and your Aunt Sally will <em>ever</em> know that the
star is named for her (unless somebody happens to stay in her spare bedroom).
No astronomer, astrologer, or anybody else will pay any attention to that
company's list.
<br><br>

<li>The only organization that officially names stars is the International
Astronomical Union (IAU), and
<a href="http://www.iau.org/public/buying_star_names/">their rules</a>
preclude the general public from selecting names (in general, the discoverer
gets to choose the name).
<br><br>

<li>A different company in the same business will eventually
sell the <em>same star</em> to somebody else.
<br><br>

<li>The money will not be used to benefit astronomers, science, the general
public, or anybody else except for the scam artists who run these companies.
</ul>

<p>I included that last item for a good reason.  You can give basically
the same gift by "adopting" a zoo animal in honor of Aunt Sally.  And
the money actually benefits a good cause.  Or you can also make a
donation to almost any charity in Sally's honor, and they will send a
grateful acknowledgment to her.

<p>Or you could just print up your own darn star certificate; it will be
every bit as valid as the ones from the companies that sell them.  Then
you could pick a star that really says something about Sally, like
the neutron star in the Crab nebula (you never did really like Aunt Sally).

<p>If you really have your heart set on sending one of the companies your
money, just ask yourself if you feel good about supporting a company that
makes most of it's profit by deceiving it's customers.  If you're cool
with that, then go right ahead.  Make the check out to "Steven Ford" and
send it to me.  I'll make sure that the company gets the money, and your
Aunt Sally will get a gift that she won't soon forget.  ;-)

<p>Cecil Adams agrees with me; see <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_385.html">http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_385.html</a>
