Star Hopping
</h1>
<hr>

<p>One of the many pleasures of astronomy is "star hopping".  Some people
use setting circles, or even a computer operated telescope, to point at
whatever object they want to see.  Many others, including myself, have
discovered that the thrill of the chase is almost as great as looking
at the intended object.

<p>Star hopping consists of starting out pointing your scope at an
easily found bright star that happens to be close to your intended
target.  Then you gradually work your way over to the object, using a
star map to show you the way.  When you first start out, it can be slow
going (especially since the view in the scope is often oriented differently
than the map).  But when you finally get to your destination, you will
not only have a feeling of accomplishment, you will also have seen some
nice sights along the way.

<p>I will be putting some hints of my own on this page soon.  Until
then, here are some other pages that tell you how to do it:

<p>There are also some books on star hopping.  I haven't seen any of
them, but here are some references I found:
