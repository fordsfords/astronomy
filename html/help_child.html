<p>You can help your child get a good start with astronomy in several ways:
<ul>
<li>Help to learn how to
<a href=#scope>use the telescope</a> effectively.
<li>Help to
<a href=#objects>find interesting objects</a> to look at.
<li>Help to to get started
<a href=#science>learning the science</a> of the universe.
<li><a href=#enthusiasm>Be enthusiastic</a> when your child drags you
outside to look at something.
</ul>

<p>So, what's the point of all this effort?  Well, besides the fact that a
little up-front investment in time can actually
<a href=free_time.html>save you time</a> in the future, ask yourself if
you've ever seen an astronomer gang banger.

<a name=scope></a>
<h3>Using the Telescope</h3>

<p>A few quick tips for your child (and you):
<ul>
<li>Don't touch any of the glass surfaces of the telescope.  Also, be
careful when you clean the glass if it gets dirty.  There are filmy coatings
that are there on purpose - don't try to scrub them off.  If you <em>must</em>
clean the glass, dampen a Q-tip with a drop of alcohol and using a
circular motion, wipe the glass.  Hold the Q-tip at a shallow angle and
slowly twirl it as you wipe to lift any finger prints off.  Finally, don't
ruin it by trying too hard to get smudges off - just use the
scope with the smudges.  The less you clean, the better.
<li>Plan a little before going out.  Use the star gazing book to
decide what you'll try to find.  Figure out about where it will be
in the sky using the planisphere.  Once out there, don't be afraid to
stray from the plan and just look where your curiosity draws you,
but believe me, a plan will still help you.
<li>It gets colder than you think at night.  Remember, you'll just be
sitting there - bring warmer clothes than you think you need.
<li>Give your eyes a chance to adjust to the dark.  It can take a
good 10 minutes before you'll be able to see anything at all, and
it can take over an hour for your eyes to completely adjust so you can
see faint things.
<li>Find the darkest spot you can.  If you can see a bright light
from where you're standing, your eyes won't properly adjust to the
dark and you won't see much.  This includes the moon - when I'm not
moon watching, I try to get the peak of my house to shield me from
the moon's light.  Whatever you do, <em>don't</em> let anybody turn on
the outdoor light!
<li>Get comfortable!  Star gazing is a lot less fun if your neck and
legs get cramped.  Use a chair and adjust the scope so that you can
easily view in comfort.
</ul>

<p>Here's a few longer-winded tips:

<h5>Ignore Setting Circles</h5>

<p>Many scopes have a type of tripod called an Equatorial mount (EQ).  These
can take a little extra getting used to, but once you get the hang of
them they aren't significantly harder to use than ALT-AZ mounts (e.g. "Dob"
mounts).  The key is that you want to <em>ignore</em> the setting circles!

<p>The theory is that you can find objects by their celestial coordinates
(RA and DEC).  Dial in the right numbers and your scope is pointing right
at the object.

<p>Nice in theory, bad in practice.  First off, in order for the circles
to be valid, you have to properly align and calibrate the scope.  You
must do this EVERY TIME YOU GO OUT!  I find it easy to make mistakes
when calibrating the RA circle.  Finally, on an inexpensive scope, they
may not be accurate enough to be usable anyway.  And even when it's all
done right, it's tedious, takes time away from actual viewing, and
takes away half the fun of astronomy - the thrill of the hunt.  Tracking
down a faint object by <a href="hopping.html">star hopping</a> can give
a nice feeling of accomplishment and pride.  Plus the sights on the
way can be just as interesting as the final destination!

<p>No matter what kind of mount you have, you will see the view slowly drift
across the eyepiece (unless you have a motor).  The advantage of an EQ mount
is that you only have to
adjust one knob to bring the object back to the center.  Also, you can 
usually get a motor drive for the mount, which slowly moves the scope to keep
the object centered.  Very handy, especially if you like to sketch what you
see.

<p>You get these benefits even if you don't bother with the alignment and
setting circles.  Just point the "axis" roughly North and you're ready!

<p>I've heard a lot of arguments in favor of"Dob" mounts, but I've never
used one.  <a href="eq.html">I like my EQ mount</a>, because of it's motor.

<a name="finder"></a>
<h5>Finder Scope</h5>

<p>Probably the hardest thing to get used to with your first telescope is
finding the thing that you're trying to see.  It's pretty easy with the
moon, and only a little harder for the brightest planets, but it takes
practice to be able to get a certain star in view (usually the first step
in finding many interesting objects).  Since all stars look the same,
and you don't have the advantage of seeing a large area of the sky at
the same time, how do you know that you've got the right star?

<p>The finder scope makes the job a lot easier.  It gives a wide-angle
view which can help.  But for a beginner, it can still be hard.

<p>Many people (myself included) have the best luck with
the "both eyes open" method.
Look through the finder scope but keep the other eye open too.  Find
the star you're looking for with your "free" eye.  Then move the
telescope until the star is approximately in the middle of the circle
of the finder scope.  By then, it actually appear in the finder scope
and you can fine tune it.

<p>But there are two problems with this method.  First, the finder
scope magnifies the view, which makes it impossible for your eyes to
really match up the view.  Worse yet, the finder makes everything look
upside-down and backwards!  A beginner can have a lot of trouble
"seeing" both the naked-eye view and the finderscope view at the same
time and making sense out of it.

<p>In spite of those difficulties, many people are able to practice
the "both eyes open" technique and master it in a few nights.  Others just
can't get the hang of it.  Those people should get a non-magnifying
finder.  I even have
<a href=nomag_find.html>plans to make one</a> using a paper towel tube
and some glue.  It looks cheap, but it works.

<p>Many many people swear by a different kind of finder - a
<a href="http://209.66.79.54/CATALOG/746/48397.HTM">Telrad Reflex Sight</a>
($50 US).  Like my cardboard tube, it is a non-magnifying finder.  Unlike my 
cardboard tube, it is a precision piece of equipment that will very
accurately position your scope where you want it.  It is available in
almost any astronomy catalog, so shop around for the best price.

<h5>Learn the Sky</h5>

<p>One goal for a beginner should be to learn the sky.  This means being
able to find the important constellations.  My personal approach has
been to concentrate on one or two constellations for an evening's observation.
I use Ridpath's
<a href="http://www.skypub.com/catalog/startast.html#ridpath">"Monthly Sky Guide"</a>
and choose any of the months close
to the current one.  For example, if it's January, I look at November,
December, Jan, Feb, and Mar (the latter may require staying up a little
later at night).  Whichever month I choose, I check the constellations
that it references and I learn them in the sky as my first task of the
evening.  (Most people seem to prefer
"<a href="http://www.skypub.com//catalog/obsbooks.html#turnleft">Turn Left
at Orion</a>".)

<p>Orient yourself
and the planisphere correctly and try to pick out the major stars of
the constellation.  Sometimes it's helpful to start from a constellation
you already know and find "pointer stars".  For example, look at your
planisphere and follow the handle of the big dipper, away from the
dipper's bowl.  As you go off the end of the handle, continue along the
same curve.  You will find that this curved line will almost exactly meet
the bottom bright star of Bootes.  Judge the distance by estimating
how many "handles worth" it is.  Then look in the sky and trace the line.

<p>Remember that the constellations will usually be larger than you
expect.  The first time I tried to find the square of Pegasus, it took me
a long time until I realize that the square is HUGE.  It takes up a
large part of the sky.  The star maps do a bad job of preparing you for
the sizes of things.

<p>Finally, one nice thing about Ridpath's "Monthly Sky Guide" is the
little picture of a fist you'll see on most of the detail maps.  This is
intended to look the same as holding your fist straight out from your body.
Use it to judge distances.

<h3>Finding Interesting Objects</h3>

<p>Look up in the night sky and find a bright star.  What does it look
like?  A white dot.  Now point a $30,000 super-deluxe telescope at it
and tell me what it looks like.  A white dot.

<p>Ho hum.

<p>Contrary to what many might think, amateur astronomers almost never
look at plain old stars through their telescopes.  I'll give some
information in this page, but I suggest Ridpath's "Monthly Sky Guide" for
a month-by-month description of interesting objects to look at.

<p>The things that amateur astronomers look at fall into two categories:

<ul>
<li>Solar system objects - planets, asteroids, the Moon (and the moons of
other planets), comets (when they're close by), and sometimes the
Sun (not for beginners though).
<br><br>

<li>Deep space objects - colorful stars, multiple star systems (two or more
stars orbiting each other), open star clusters, globular clusters, nebulae,
variable stars, and galaxies.
</ul>

<h5>Solar System Objects</h5>

<p>For a child just beginning with the telescope, by far the most fascinating
thing for them to look at is the Moon.  Fortunately, it's also the easiest
thing to find.  When the moon is full, the view is actually the least
interesting.  Far more interesting is when there's a partial moon.  Look
at the "terminator" (the border between the lighted and dark sides).  You'll
see craters, plains, ridges, mountains, and valleys.  Look all the way up and
down the terminator to see all that the moon has to offer.  And look again
tomorrow night - the terminator is always moving as the moon waxes and wanes.
Every night gives you a different collection of surprises to examine.

<p>After the moon, the planets are the most popular objects to view,
especially Jupiter and Saturn (the two biggest planets).  They're both
pretty easy to find and get the scope pointed at, and they both present
a certain amount of interesting detail.  If you look carefully, you might
be able to see cloud bands running across them.  And, of course, there's
Saturn's ring.  That's always worth some oohs and aahs.

<p>Besides Jupiter and Saturn, it is also possible to see Venus, Mars, and
sometimes Mercury.  However, they will show little or no detail.  They will
also appear pretty small; if you increase your power (magnification) to get
a better look, the view will get fuzzier.  These three planets are definitely
worth a look - Venus changes phase just like the Moon, sometimes being almost
full, other times being a thin crescent - but they won't get the same strong
reaction as Jupiter and Saturn.

<p>The distant planets, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, are probably beyond the
reach of beginners.  With inexpensive scopes, Uranus and Neptune will only
look like dim stars, and Pluto is completely beyond their reach.

<p><b>To actually find the planets, I have a
<a href=find_planet.html>short guide</a>.</b>

<p>The other solar system objects, asteroids and the Sun, are difficult to
view and are probably not good targets for a child.  The Sun in particular
requires special equipment to safely view.  If you scope came with a small
filter that screws to the back of an eyepiece, I would suggest <em>not</em>
using it.  If that filter gets even a tiny crack in it, you can go blind
in a few seconds.

<h5>Deep Space Objects</h5>

<p>I happen to be more interested in deep space objects than planets.  For
me, the much of the thrill is in the chase.  Also, I find the science
behind the deep space objects to be more interesting than planetary science.
I mean, so what if there's a big storm on Jupiter.  But an exploding star?
That's cool.

<p>Unfortunately, with a few notable exceptions, they are harder to find in a
telescope.  This is one area where the skill of observing needs to be
developed over time.  Usually you start at a nearby bright star, and then
slowly step your way to the object in question, carefully tracking your
progress against a star chart.

<p>Sounds hard and tedious, right?  It can be for a beginner.  That's why
I usually suggest starting with solar system objects.  They're easier to
find and give more "instant gratification".  But most amateurs that stick
with astronomy end up working on deep space objects too, developing their
skill at finding harder and harder objects.  It's like any skill-based
hobby - the better at it you are, the more you enjoy it.

<p>Probably the easiest and coolest deep-space object to find in the sky
is the Orion nebula.  (Orion is a winter/spring constellation.)
You can see it with the naked eye as the middle star in Orion's sword.
In the finder scope, you will see that it looks a bit fuzzy or smudged.
In the main scope, you will see one of the most beautiful sights in the
sky (especially if you are under dark skies, away from big cities).
The Orion nebula is a violent and turbulent place where new stars are
actually being born.  There are four stars clustered very close together
in the center (called the "Trapezium") - you may need to increase your
power a bit to separate them.  Those four stars are hugely massive and
hot stars, far bigger and hotter than our Sun.  They are giving off
so much ionizing radiation that they are responsible for lighting up the
entire nebula (don't worry, the radiation is not dangerous to look at).

<p>After the Orion nebula, open star clusters are probably the easiest
things to find.  Many globular clusters are fairly easy to find.  I
happen to like star clusters a lot.

<p>Nebulae (other than Orion's) are harder things to find.  There are
a few within the reach of an inexpensive telescope - use Ridpath's
"Monthly Sky Guide" to find them - but they mostly require bigger scopes
and dark skies (far from large cities).

<a name=science></a>
<h3>Learning the Science</h3>

<p>I don't necessarily mean that <em>you</em> should learn a lot of
the science of astronomy.  Rather, I think that your child should get
started doing so.  I don't say this just because I think everybody should
be scientists.  Rather, if astronomy is going to be a long-term hobby,
<em>some</em> interest in the science behind it is going to be there.

<p>I actually believe that knowledge of the universe <em>increases</em>
your enjoyment of observing through the telescope.  For example, if
you look at the Orion nebula without knowing anything about it, you're
likely to say, "How nice.  A space cloud."  But when you know what's
going on in it, your imagination soars.  "I'm seeing new stars and
solar systems being formed before my very eyes!"

<p>Another example - if you take a road trip to dark skies and
look at the Crab Nebula, you might say, "gee,
the <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap951122.html">photo I've seen</a>
shows cool colors and detail.  This just looks like a dim smudge.  I drove
all that way for <em>this</em>?"  But, when you
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/cossc/apod_search?crab+nebula">learn</a>
that the Crab is the remains of a tremendous star explosion
(supernova), and that these explosions are the only way known in the universe
that most of the chemical elements are formed, and that much of the very
atoms that you and I are made of come from the remains of past supernovae,
and the star in the middle of the Crab (you can't see it with your telescope,
but it's there) is a "neutron star pulsar" and is about as heavy as our own
Sun but is only about as big around as a small town, and that it is
spinning over 30 revolutions <em>per second</em>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
suddenly you look at that dim smudge with new respect.  (BTW, the Crab
nebula is almost impossible to see from a suburban site.  But it's pretty
easy to find for an "experienced beginner" in a country setting with no
bright lights nearby.)

<p>One of the best places to learn it is on the Internet.  One of the
best places on the Internet is
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">Astronomy Picture of the Day ("APOD")</a>.
It is so much <em>more</em> than just pretty pictures; APOD gives explanation
with plenty of links for more in-depth info.  It is the <em>only</em> web
page that I really do check every day.  For example, APOD gives good
views of the
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap970511.html">Orion nebula</a>
and <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960909.html">Crab nebula</a>,
complete with explanations of what they are.

<p>I'm not trying to make you or your kid into a scientist (they don't make
enough money).  But a little understanding of the universe can help you
enjoy astronomy more, and can even help you put your life's problems into
some perspective.  I find it somewhat comforting that all my boss' bluster
is insignificant compared to the storms near the edge of a
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap970613.html">black hole</a>.

<p>Never being at a loss for words, I have
<a href=index.html>more to say</a> about astronomy and science.

<a name=enthusiasm></a>
<h3>Being Enthusiastic</h3>

<p>When your child drags you out to look at a fuzzy patch of light,
ask questions about it.  What is it?  How big is it in real life?  How far
away is it?  What's it made out of?  How does it interact with other
nearby objects?  What constellation is it in?  How did you find it?

<p>Well, don't go overboard - this is supposed to be fun, not a final
exam.  However, asking some questions does show an interest on your part,
which validates the child's own interest.  It also might trigger some
investigation by the child.  All of this can help your child get more
deeply involved in astronomy.

<p>Encourage your child to keep a log or journal of the observations.
It can even be fun to try to draw what you see.  Before the days of
sensitive film, drawings are all that astronomers had to go by; you
can follow in the steps of Messier and maybe even discover a comet!
(OK, not very likely, but you never know...)

<p>Remember, a little praise can go a loooooong way!

<p>Finally, if there's an
astronomy club in your area (ask a near-by school's science teacher),
then you should get in contact with them.  They hold "star parties"
where you can see first-hand what astronomy is all about.  These are
"kid-friendly" events that let you see a variety of sights through
a range of telescopes.

<h3>In Conclusion...</h3>

<p>I know I've probably made all this sound like a lot of work.  Don't
worry, the idea is to help get your child started doing it, not for
<em>you</em> to do all this learning and research.  Once your child
gets to see astronomy at it's best, the rest will depend on that child's
personality and interests.

<p>My biggest goal in writing this guide is so that a child might avoid
repeating <a href=my_past.html>my first experience</a> with astronomy.
But even if your child's interest wanes and the telescope ends up in
the basement, at least your child (and maybe even you) have learned something.
