<h1>
Equatorial Mounts
</h1>
<hr>

<p>One of the religious wars that perpetually breaks out in the
sci.astro.amateur newsgroup is an argument over which is better: Dobsonian
(Dob) or Equatorial (EQ) mounts.  Having never used a Dob, I can't really
compare.  (But <a href="dob.txt">Keith Wichman</a> can!)  However,
I am frequently struck by the arguments that pro-Dob people give.

<p>I should mention that I have a Celestar-8 scope on the standard wedge
mount.  I've never used a German-style mount - it might suffer more from
the claimed disadvantages of EQ.  I don't know.  I'll only speak to
Celestron's wedge.  Also, I'll ignore the more expensive Dobs that include
motor drives.  The debate generally rages around less expensive
scopes.

<h3>Setup Time</h3>

<p>One big argument used against EQs is setup time.  Dobs take very little
time and effort to set up, which supposedly removes a barrier to using
the scope.  I laugh when I see this argument.

<p>When I'm ready to use my scope, I open the door, pick up the scope, walk
outside, and set it down.  Done.  With a Dob, I assume I would have to make
two trips.  EQ wins.

<p>Closely related is the time it takes to polar align an EQ.  I polar
align as I set the scope down.  North is right over <em>there</em> (see
me pointing?), so I set the scope down with the polar axis pointing roughly
North.  Done.  Zero extra time.  EQ still wins.

<p>What about the setting circles?  I almost never use them (see below
for rare exceptions).

<p>What about when I'm not going to my back yard?  OK, now it <em>is</em>
more time-consuming.  I have to undo three bolts.  That takes about
four minutes, including threading the bolts back in the mount so they
won't get lost.  Then when I'm on-site, I must re-assemble - that's
another 4 minutes.  Will that 8-minute overhead cause me to use the
scope less often?  Good grief NO!  The overhead involved in just loading
the car with everything, driving to a site, and unloading the car FAR
outweighs the extra 8 minutes.  <em>That</em> is the overhead that
causes 98% of my viewing to be from my back yard; it would be no different
with a Dob.

<p>So, for setup time the EQ either wins or ties.  (See next section for
child-related issues.)

<h3>Size</h3>

<p>My Celestar-8 is about at my limit for carrying it outside easily.
I'm not very strong; even a 10-inch SCT would be more than I could
handle.  In that case, the take-apart and put-back-together times
<em>would</em> become significant for back-yard viewing, and I probably
would use a Dob more often.

<p>For children, the situation is more significant.  Depending on the age
and strength of the child, even a 4.5-inch reflector on a tripod might be
more than he could handle by himself.  And if at all possible, <b>the
child should be able to accomplish setup without help</b>.

<p>Again, my lack of direct experience hinders me; there may well be
a range of ages and scope sizes for which a child could handle a Dob but
not a tripod-mounted scope.  In this case, the answer is obvious.  Go
with the Dob.  If the child has to wait for somebody else to help set up
the scope, it will be used a small fraction of the times that a
self-serve scope would be used.  And, as everybody agrees, the best scope
is the one that gets used the most.

<p>Closely related is the hight of the eyepiece.  Small Dobs are usually
more kid-friendly.  With an EQ, the real shrimps need a ladder to see
things close to the horizon!  As before, if a tripod-mounted scope
is of a size that makes it difficult for a child to reach the finder,
then a smaller mount is in order.  It's hard to beat a 4-inch Dob in
that respect.

<p>So, at least for adults, the size only matters for 10-inch or bigger
scopes.  For my 8-inch, there is no advantage or disadvantage either way.

<h3>Difficulty of Use</h3>

<p>It is true that an EQ is significantly more difficult to use, <em>if you
use the setting circles</em> to find objects.  I don't, and other beginners
probably shouldn't either.  Again, I can't really compare since I've
never used a Dob, but it only took me one evening to get used to the
initial strangeness of sweeping it around the sky.  Maybe it's harder
for German-style EQs, I don't know.  But my wedge is perfectly easy
to point.

<p>I can imagine that the EQ mounts might <em>look</em> more complicated
than Dob mounts.  I love gadgets, so that's actually a minor advantage
for me.  But I think that one evening's worth of using an EQ is enough
to get people over that aspect of it.

<p>The only complexity left is the fact that after you've swept an EQ to
point approximately at the intended target, you have to lock it down.
I believe that this is something you don't have to do with a DOB.  Once
you've locked an EQ, you have to fine-tune it with knobs instead of nudges.  I
guess that <em>is</em> a little more complicated.  However, most people I know
<em>like</em> to turn knobs!  They want to think they're doing something
a bit more high-tech than just wrestling with a big tube.

<p>I will admit that twisting a knob is slightly more
complicated than giving a tube a push.

<p>But there is one area where the EQ is easier to use - tracking objects
across the sky.  With a Dob, you have to nudge it.  For beginners, they
will invariably nudge it the wrong way and will have to re-nudge it a
few times.  One slip and it's time to star-hop again.  With an EQ, the
whole point is to make tracking easy.  Turn a knob.  If you turned it
the wrong way, turn it back.  Almost zero chance of "losing" the
object.

<p>Once again, with children it might be more of an issue.  Perhaps they
would have trouble keeping the scope pointed roughly at the object while
they lock it down.  Perhaps they will have trouble reaching the knobs
while looking through the eyepiece.

<p>But, at least for adults, I believe that the advantages and disadvantages
cancel each other out, leaving them equally easy to use, even for beginners.

<h3>Learning the Sky</h3>

<p>Here is a pro-Dob argument that genuinely annoys me.  A Dob "forces" you to
learn the sky.  Maybe I'm just a cowboy at heart, but I don't like people
trying to <em>force</em> me to do something for my own good.  <em>Convince</em>
me that it's a good idea to learn the sky, and I'll do it no matter what
mount I have.  As it happens, I already know the value of learning the sky,
and I have been doing exactly that.  But the notion that the unwashed
masses are too stupid to understand the value of learning the sky ... well
that puts me off no end.  (It almost makes me want to recommend EQs just
out of spite.)

<p>When I first got my Celestar 8, I used the
setting circles instead of learning to star-hop.  It let me see some
pretty cool things right, from the start!  However, it didn't take long
for me to get tired of aligning, so I started to star-hop.
So for me, the setting circles were actually a stepping-stone to learning
the sky and star-hopping.

<p>Maybe the issue is different with a computerized model.  Perhaps there
are people who will never try to learn star hopping, will use the scope for
a year, and then say, "Is that all there is?"  These people may well
benefit from a few sessions of star-hopping; they might discover
an unexpected treasure chest of joy.  On the other hand, there may be
just as many people who have enough trouble learning to star-hop that
they give it up in frustration.  A little bit of success with setting circles
might do them wonders.

<p>But I claim that it's not an argument against EQ mounts.  It's
an argument in <em>favor</em> of better education of beginners.

<h3>Using the Setting Circles</h3>

<p>I mentioned above that I don't use the setting circles very much.
However, there are two circumstances where I <em>do</em> use them, and
it is a great help to me.

<p>I live in a heavily light-polluted area.  Sometimes, when hunting for
an object in a star-poor field, I simply can't get there.  I'm slowly
learning some techniques on how to do it, but it still happens.  In that
case, it's nice to be able to take a few minutes to get my polar alignment
a little more accurate, set the circles, and point right at the object.
Then, much like solving a maze starting from the <em>destination</em>, I
work my way out, finding landmarks as I go.

<p>Secondly, here's a technique that I'm somewhat proud of, as I discovered
it without any hints.  My back yard is such that the "horizons" are fairly
high.  During the first 3 months of having my scope, I could not find
Mercury.  Any time it is high enough off the horizon to be visible above
the surrounding trees and houses, the sky is way too bright to find it,
even with binoculars (at least my crummy 7x35 pair).

<p>Then, I figured it out.  I woke up shortly before dawn.  I used SkyMap
to get the RA and DEC of Mercury.  Then, I polar aligned and set the circles
using bright stars.  Finally, I pointed the scope at the right coordinates
(below the horizon), switched on the motor, and went back inside for
breakfast.  A half-hour later, the scope was pointing above the tree line,
and Mercury was right there, surrounded by a pink sky.  No hint of it in
the finder scope (a crummy 6x30), but clear as a bell in the eyepiece.

<p>No way in the world you could do that with a Dob.

<h3>Expense</h3>

<p>As the scopes get larger, it rapidly becomes very difficult to
mount them on a tripod.  For a 4-inch, a Dob is only slightly less
expensive than an EQ.  An 8-inch SCT is <em>significantly</em> more
expensive than an 8-inch Dob.

<p>I'm very fortunate that I had the money to get what I really
wanted, an 8-inch SCT (it's the largest aperture for the degree of
portability that I want).
But for people on a tighter budget, it would be hard to resist
the extra size that a given dollar will buy you with a Dob.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I can imagine several circumstances where a Dob is definitely the
way to go.  Large aperture, a child who can't carry a tripod-mount,
a cost-constrained budget,
or a person who, for whatever reason, just has more fun with a Dob.

<p>But even for beginning adults, I see cost as being the only reason
to favor a Dob over an EQ mount.
