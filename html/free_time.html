<h1>No Time to Help Junior with the Telescope</h1>
<hr>

<p>Well, you thought you were just going to buy a telescope, give it
to your kid, and be done with it.  Now, I'm trying to talk you into
spending a bunch of time learning how to use the darn thing, learning
a little about astronomy, learning how to find planets and stars in
the sky.

<p>Sure, you'll do that.  Just as soon as you get home late because
of that <em>very important</em> (read "boring") meeting, help the
kids with some homework, run to the store and the cleaners, get
some money from the local ATM machine, get some gas, go back home, and
return a few calls.  No problem.  You probably have a whole 15
seconds of free time so far this week!

<p>Look, I'm a parent and I know where your coming from.

<p>Fortunately, I'm not advocating that you spend <em>lots</em> of
time working with your child.  I'm just suggesting that you spend
a little time <em>up front</em>, soon after you give the scope.
If you don't, you increase the chances that your child will become
frustrated and lose interest and will come back to you in a few
weeks saying, "I'm bored.  There's nothing to do."

<p>That's the wonderful thing about a hobby.  If your child gets
truly interested in astronomy, it will provide plenty of
entertainment and education.  Some kids get interested enough
to start making their own telescopes.  If that happens at your
house, you can forget having to drive your kid to soccer lessons,
gymnastics lessons, swimming lessons, golf lessons, and all those
other commitments that steal hours from your day.  Astronomy is
a hobby that can be enjoyed at home.

<p>And it even provides entertainment when the skies are cloudy.
The Internet has <em>vast</em> resources available.  There are
books and magazines to be read, catalogs to be browsed, observations
to be planned.

<p>Naturally, it's a gamble.  Your child may lose interest anyway.  But
even if that happens, both of you probably learned a fair amount.  And
you may have even had a bit of quality time together.  It's so crazy, it
just might work!
