<p>This is a guide for the adult who has a strong interest in astronomy
and wants to get into it more actively.  Presumably, this means that
you want to get a nice telescope.

<p>If you are planning on getting a telescope for a child, then I have a
<a href=kid_scope.html>different guide</a> for you.  There is a fair
amount of content overlap between these two guides, but the thrust is
different.  In this one, I assume that you have a reasonable expectation
that your interest in astronomy will last longer than a month or two.
I also assume that you are willing to spend more money than you would
on a young child, and that you are willing to "work harder" at it.
Kids need a lot of instant gratification; adults are better able to
appreciate subtle beauty and longer-term satisfaction.

<p>I am very much in love with astronomy, in spite of a
<a href=my_past.html>rocky start</a>.  It's a wonderful hobby that can
be both challenging and relaxing (not to mention educational).  I would
like to share some of this love, partly to get you enthused and started
on the right track, but also to give you a peek at what amateur astronomy
is <em>really</em> all about.  If it really isn't for you, I hope that
this guide will save you the frustration and money that an unused
telescope would cause you.

<p>Like many beginners, I started out with my telescope, a set of star
charts, and a lot of enthusiasm.  The scope came with an instruction
manual which gave a list of the Messier objects (galaxies, nebulae and
star clusters) that it claimed should be within reach of the scope.  So,
I set about calibrating the setting circles for the sky's coordinates,
pointed the scope at the coordinates where one of the objects was supposed
to be, and took a look.

<p>Nothing.

<p>Let's just say that it has taken me until now (over 6 months) to figure
out how I <em>should</em> have gotten started.

<p>I don't claim that the approach described here is the only, or even
the best way to get started in astronomy.  I'm sure that many amateurs
would argue with many of my choices.  However, I believe that starting
out this way is <em>one</em> way to get a good start.  If you're as lost
as I was, give this a try.

<h3>Would I Make a Good Astronomer?</h3>

<p>Many people are disappointed when they first get a telescope.  They're used
to seeing amazing color photographs of  galaxies and nebulae.  But these
photos are taken with long exposures in very sensitive films.  When looking
through the eyepiece of even a HUGE telescope, you won't see anything like
that.

<p>In my opinion, you need to have three characteristics (some would say
character flaws) in order to build a long-lasting love of astronomy:

<ul>
<li>Love of Science - learning about the universe.
<li>Love of Technology - shopping for, buying, and using the equipment
(telescopes, eyepieces, finders, filters, dew shields, ... whole catalogs full
of stuff).
<li>Love of Observing - beauty, peace, challenge.
</ul>

<p>Different people will have these ingredients in different proportions - I
happen to have a great love of science and observing, and only a mild interest
in the technology.  But I believe that you need at least <em>some</em> of all
three to be a happy astronomer.

<p>If you don't mind my rambling a bit, you can see my
<a href=loves.html>longer treatment<a> of this subject.  After reading
it, I hope you'll have a better idea of whether you will stick with it
for a while.

<h3>What Am I Going to Need?</a>

<p>Naturally, the centerpiece is the telescope itself.  However, many would
argue that the telescope is the single <em>least</em> important thing to
get.  Ironic, since it is also the most expensive.  However, I'm going to
put off discussing the telescope until <a href=scope>later</a>.  Even if
it isn't the <em>least</em> important thing, the items described here
are still very important.
