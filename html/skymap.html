<h1>SkyMap Review</h1>
<hr>

<p>I believe that a sky mapping program for you home computer can be
very useful, whether you are a beginner or an experienced astronomer.
As a beginner, it can help you learn the constellations and locate
planets.  Most sky mapping packages also provide these features:

<ul>
<li>You can get sky views (showing you the horizon) or detailed maps
of smaller areas.
<li>You can get backwards and/or upside down maps to make it easier to
star-hop (you don't have to mentally translate top-bottom, right-left).
<li>You can get a certain amount of data about individual
objects (e.g. star mags to the nearest 0.1).
<li>You can display the path traced by moving objects over time.
<li>They usually come with a catalog of comets and asteroids, which can
be updated as new ones are found or orbits change.
<li>Most of them will interface with some telescope's computer control port
to make finding objects trivial (although this seems to take away half the
fun of using a telescope, in my humble opinion).
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/yoursky/">http://www.fourmilab.ch/yoursky/</a>
is a web site that provides most of these functions <em>for free</em>.
Unfortunately, like most web sites, this one is slow, has pretty low
resolution maps, and isn't nearly as user-friendly as a good package that
you install on your computer.

<p>Every package has a certain following of amateurs who swear by that
package over all others.  I do not claim to have wide experience - I only
know about one package: SkyMap.  (For a pretty long list of packages,
see <a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/astrosoftware.html">http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/astrosoftware.html</a>.)

<p>Fortunately, it does everything that I want.  It
is easy and intuitive to use.  And it is among the least expensive packages.
I particularly like it's "real-time" mode of operation which locks in on
the current time and shows you the sky as it is <em>right now</em>.  In
addition to being a useful tool for observing, I kind of like just playing
with it, bringing up various views, zooming in on interesting objects,
comparing distances, etc.

<p>It is shareware, which means that you can download it for free and use
it for a certain period of time.  SkyMap's trial period is not defined by
an amount of calendar time, rather it is defined by the number of
different days you use it - 30 to be exact.  So, if you only bring the
program up one day a month, you have a 30 month trial period.  Considering
that most places have more cloudy nights than clear, most people can get
a lot of use before the package expires.

<p>If you decide to buy it, you can get the "cheap" version for $50 US, which
has many more stars in it than the evaluation version (which makes it
easier to find some objects), or you can get he "expensive" version for
$80 US which comes on CD ROM and has more stars than you
can shake a telescope at.

<p>Alas, it is only available for MS Windows (3.1, 95, or NT).  Mac users
will need to find something else.

<p>You can get info about SkyMap at
<a href="http://www.skymap.com/">http://www.skymap.com/</a>.  You can download
an evaluation copy at
<a href="http://www.skymap.com/skymap_eval.htm">http://www.skymap.com/skymap_eval.htm</a>.

<p>Although I haven't tried it, I've heard good things about <b>SkyGlobe</b>.
Alas, there doesn't seem to be an "official" site for it.  Since it's
shareware, you're supposed to pay for it, but I can't find the info.  Perhaps
that comes with it when you download it, which you can do from
<a href="http://download.com/PC/Result/TitleDetail/0,4,0-18000,501000.html">http://download.com/PC/Result/TitleDetail/0,4,0-18000,501000.html</a>
(DOS program compatible with Windows).
